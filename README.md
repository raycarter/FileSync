FileSync
========

Features:

	Version 1.0.3:
	
		1. Simple Log-function is built in to log which files are copied. The log-files are created with timestamps as name and stored in folder log/.  
		
	Version 1.0.2:
	
		1. Progress bar is pulled in to show executing progress. 
		
	Version 1.0.1:
	
		1. Thread is pulled in to execute the sync in background. 
		
	Version 1.0.0:

		1. Not like Dropbox, there is no bidirectional sync. 

		2. The program checks that if all files in the destination folder recursively are the same as in the source folder based on filenames and timestamps. 

		3. Same files(same Name and timestamp) are skipped. Unlike Windows-Copy, it has to be confirmed to overwrite or ignore the files with same names.
		
		4. Under Windows operation systems is the .exe needed to gain the right to copy or overwrite folders and files in particular positions(like C:\Program files).
