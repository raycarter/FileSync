FileSync
========

Features:

	Version 1.0:

		1. Not like Dropbox, there is no bidirectional sync. 

		2. The program checks that if all files in the destination folder recursively are the same as in the source folder based on filenames and date stamples. 

		3. Under Windows operation systems is the .exe needed to gain the right to copy or overwrite folders and files in particular positions(like C:\Program files).
